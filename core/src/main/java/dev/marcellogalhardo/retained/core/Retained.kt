 * E.g., if it is an `Activity`, until it is finished.
 *
 * In other words, this means that a retained object will not be destroyed if its owner is
 * destroyed for a configuration change (e.g., rotation). The new instance of the owner will just
 * re-connected to the existing retained object.

 * class ViewModel(val name: String = "")

 * [ViewModel], and access prior to that will result in [IllegalStateException].

 * @param findViewModelStoreOwner The [ViewModelStoreOwner] used to scope the retained instance.
